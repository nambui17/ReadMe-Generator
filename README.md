  ## Installation

  The README Generator is used by first installing node.js. Download node.js.

  [node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  When node.js has finished downloading, open the downloaded file to install node.js. A screen should appear and ask if you want to run the software. Press Run to continue. The node.js Setup Wizard will be launched and lead the user through the installation of node.js. The Node Package Manager (npm) is included in the install for node.js. Review the license agreement and click next to install node.js. The Setup Wizard will ask for the installation location. Unless there is a need to install node.js somewhere else, leave the default file location to install node.js. The Setup Wizard will also ask for the user to select components to include or remove from installation. Keep the defaults and click ```Next``` to continue. Click the ```Install``` button to run the installer. When the installer finishes, click ```Finish``` to continue. Exit out of any terminals that are open (e.g. Git Bash, terminal, etc.) to refresh the terminals and use node.js.

  Clone the README Generator repo to your local machine. This will repo already includes a package.json but if in any case the package.json file is not present, run ```npm init -y``` at the command line to generate an empty package.json file.

  Run ```npm i inquirer@8.2.4``` to install inquirer version 8.2.4. This will generate a package-lock.json file with inquirer as well as update the package.json file to include inquirer version 8.2.4. This will also generate node-modules folder with many different modules but it will include the inquirer module folder.

  Now you're ready to use the README Generator!

  ## Usage
  
  Run ```node index.js``` after navigating to the README-Generator folder at the command line to start the README Generator CLI application. The application will lead you through several prompts with questions about the title of the project, description of the project, installation instructions, etc. Enter any information you want to include in the README here. After all prompts have been answered, a README will be generated with the data entered into the prompts. The generated README will have the filename README.md. A sample README that was generated using this application is included under a different title SAMPLE_README in the GitHub Repo.
